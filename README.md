Title: Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellation

Problem statement

Over the years, the hotel industry has changed with a majority of bookings now made through third parties such as Booking.com [(source)](https://www.hotelmanagement.net/tech/study-cancelation-rate-at-40-as-otas-push-free-change-policy). Those Online Travel Agencies (OTA) have transformed cancellation policies from a footnote at the bottom of the page to the main selling point in their marketing campaigns [(source)](https://triptease.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-free-cancellations/). As a result, customers have become accustomed to free cancellation policies. In fact, a study conducted by D-Edge Hospitality Solutions found that cancellation rate across all channels has risen by 6% over the past four years, reaching almost 40% in 2018 [(source)](https://www.d-edge.com/how-online-hotel-distribution-is-changing-in-europe/). This increase in booking cancellation makes it harder for hotels to accurately forecast, leading to non-optimized occupancy and revenue loss [(source)](https://www.d-edge.com/how-online-hotel-distribution-is-changing-in-europe/).

In order to solve this problem, we will use a real life hotel booking dataset to create a customer segmentation analysis in order to gain insights about the customers (and hopefully reasons why they cancel their reservation) while incoorporating auto ML using databricks. We will then build a classification model (including the newly created customer clusters) to predict whether or not a booking will be canceled with the highest accuracy possible.   
This model will allow hotels to predict if a new booking will be canceled or not, manage their business accordingly, and increase their revenue.
